The Student Attendance & Performance Tracker
A school plans to develop a system to track student attendance and performance (through small tests or assignments) for each class.
Every class in the school is conducted by a teacher, who marks the attendance of the students present in that class. Different topics may be taught in the same class on different days. Recording daily attendance is important because it will later be used to prepare report cards.
For each student, the system should keep records of attendance, performance, and average results. At the end of the month, students can view their individual reports showing their attendance rate, marks in each test, and overall average score.
Teachers should also be able to view a summary report for a specific day's class, showing which students were absent, who scored low, and who performed best.
The school authority wants this system to be designed in a way that it can later be used in other branches (like colleges or training institutes) with minimal adjustments to the subjects or rules.
