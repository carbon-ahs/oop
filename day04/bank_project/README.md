This is an extended practice of Practice 01.

## Practice 01

In this exercise, you will create  
    - a list of Bank Accounts  
    - perform various transactions (such as withdrawals and deposits) across multiple accounts, and calculate the total balance of all the accounts owned by the Bank.

## Practice 2

The bank needs a system 
to manage customer profiles 
along with their associated credit cards. 
Each customer should have a credit card that includes details such as the card number (must be digit), expiration date, and credit limit. 

The system must verify if a credit card is valid by checking its expiration date. Additionally, the system should track a customer’s available credit after purchases and allow for the calculation of outstanding balance based on the credit limit (500K) and spending. 

The system must also ensure the customer’s eligibility for credit based on their age (minimum 18 years).
