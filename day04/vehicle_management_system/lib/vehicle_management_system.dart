  A vehicle class to represent a generic vehicle.
  The vehicle registration authority
requires a system to 
manage car details
and their associated 
license plates. 


The system must 
validate the license plate by ensuring it is current and not expired. 

Additionally, the system should track the carâ€™s owner information, manufacturer, model, and year of manufacture. 

It must also calculate the age (twenty years or less) of the car to determine if it qualifies for registration renewal .
